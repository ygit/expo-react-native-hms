# expo-react-native-hms

## install node modules
```
  npm i
```

## install expo-cli globally to run the expo commands
```
  npm install --global expo-cli
```

## install expo dev client
```
  expo install expo-dev-client
```

## Now we can run ios and android
```
  expo run:ios -d
```
or for android
```
  expo run: android -d
```

Alternatively for iOS we can run it from xCode and start dev server from terminal (it will help running on devices).
to start the server the following command can be used
```
  expo start --dev-client
```
